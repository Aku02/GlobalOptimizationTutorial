# GlobalOptimizationTutorial
## Hands-on Tutorial for Global Optimization in Matlab

This git repo is for the ICCV 2019 Tutorial ["Global Optimization for Geometric Understanding with Provable Guarantees"](http://globaloptimization-iccv2019.mit.edu).

Authors: [Heng Yang](http://hankyang.mit.edu), Siyi Hu, [Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu)

## Prerequisites
* CVX: Please [download CVX](http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/) according to your OS and put the "cvx" folder at the same folder level as this "GlobalOptimizationTutorial" folder (e.g. "path/Matlab/cvx" and "path/Matlab/GlobalOptimizationTutorial"), and then go inside the "cvx" folder from Matlab console and run `cvx_setup`.

## Get Started
* As simple as just openning, reading and running the `Tutorial_presentation.mlx` (`Tutorial_complete.mlx` contains the solution)
* Alternatively, you can just read the `Tutorial_complete.pdf`
